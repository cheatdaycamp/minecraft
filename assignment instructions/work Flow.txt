LANDING PAGE

- Write instructions, and set a class for them. Can't be with the same font, it is unreadable.
Some kind of 'pixel' or 'milenium 2000' font would be my approach.
- Less important: the background image in fact are 2 background images. The first one gets replaced when the device is smaller than 998.98px wide.
It should be just one background with an image element that gets its size from the viewport using the measure vmin.
It shoulbe squared, so we can say width: 30vmin for example, and also for the heigth:30vmin
and that way we dont worry how it would look on portrait/landscape devices.

MAIN
- Bootstrap the main.
- Add Iron Sword button (for removing clouds and dynamite). It is located on ../img/PNGS/Iron_Sword.png

JS
- Change the name of minecraft.start for something more representative
- Generate a double loop for the canvas creation. the first loop creates "rows".
As many rows as unitsOnHeight variable. each row would get an id like "canvasRow"+number[i] of the loop +1 (to start to count from 1)

For each row(new loop with j), create a div and append. the id would be ${row-id + number[i]} of the loop.
it is very important to add the row id because otherwise we would have duplicated IDS.

- For each toolIcon should be a specific function .removeClass for 2 elements and addclass for sky.

classes to remove for each tool
sky (Default. whenever a class is removed, sky class is added)
cloud (sword)
earth (shovel)
grass (shovel)
rock (axepick)
brick (axepick)
treetrunk (axe)
treetop (axe)
tnt (sword)

- Function for "turning" on buttons:
I used something on the paint app that could be usefull here: it is a function that given a specific class turns off
(a.k.a sets opacity to .7) to all elements of the class, except for that one that triggered the function, 
that sets it to 1. That way that button looks like active and the other like desactivated. It is triggered on click on each
element.

I think that it could be usefull for when a shovel/sword/axe/pick is selected, and also for the
material. WHen one is selected, the other ones are deselected.

// function for 'turning off' icons when another one is clicked (should be re written in jquery)
paintApp.opacityLoop = function(event, array) {
    var l = array.length,
        i = 0;
    for (i; i < l; i++) {
        if (array[i].id !== event.target.id)
            array[i].style.opacity = .7;
    }
	event.target.style.opacity = 1;
}

(actually, just grabbint the whole class in jquery, turning it to 0.7 and then turning to 1 'this' is also shorter and no need for loop)


- All the materials trigger the same function, that removes all the classes of the div (except border // or removes all then adds border again)
and adds the same class as the material button. That way, one function to all the materials.
- For the shovel, pick, axe, sword we can define manually which classes they remove.
ORRRRR we can create an object "toolbox" which has all the tools (constructor: name, classes that remove. Method: add sky) and then set one unique function
that when triggered grabs all the classes that 'this' can remove. if it matches with the div, it removes it and executes toolbox.addsky. if not, we play a wrong sound, change the background color of the tool to red for 1 second, or something.
